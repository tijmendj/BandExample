# BandExample
A trivial Java program used as an example of a simple system for my thesis.

## Purpose
My master's thesis is about Software Architecture Reconstruction, specifically using dynamic data. 
To verify that my method of instrumentation and visualization work properly, I created this small
Java application. Real-world applications generate way too much data for a human to quickly understand.
Because this application is simple and (hopefully) easy to comprehend, we can more easily test the tools and methods I present.
